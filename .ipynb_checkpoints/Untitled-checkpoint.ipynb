    "**Introduction:**</br>\n",
    "In this report, we will explore data from a video game research server named Plaicraft. Plaicraft is operated by researchers in the computer science department at UBC and is part of a study aimed at understanding the behaviours and characteristics of players who engage with the game Minecraft. The researchers aim to explore three key aspects of their audience: What kinds of players play the most, when most players tend to play, and whether a player will continue playing based on previous sessions and demographics. By analyzing these patterns, the researchers can gain valuable insight into player behaviour which will help achieve their research objective. </br>\n",
    "In this report, we aim to explore what kinds of players play the most by focusing on the following question: **Can we predict a player's total number of played hours based on characteristics such as experience, gender, age, and subscription?** </br>\n",
    "We have been provided with two datasets from the researchers; players.csv and sessions.csv. Players.csv provides information regarding the unique players on the Minecraft server, while the sessions.csv dataset contains information on individual play sessions. To address our question, we will primarily use the players.csv file as it contains each of the players' played hours and characteristics. The players.csv file has 9 variables and 196 observations. The variables are:\n",
    "- experience: A factor variable indicating the player's experience level\n",
    "- subscribe: A logical variable indicating the player's subscription status\n",
    "- hashedEmail: A char variable representing the hashed email of the user\n",
    "- played_hours: A double variable indicating total hours played\n",
    "- name: A char variable for the player's in-game name\n",
    "- gender: A factor variable indicating the player's gender\n",
    "- age: An int representing the player's age\n",
    "- individualld: Unclear, but possibly represents the total number of individuals in the player's organization (if applicable)\n",
    "- organizationName: Possibly the name of the player's organization, if applicable.</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about the player's characteristics was likely collected during the sign-up process, while the number of played hours was recorded as players engaged with the game. "

    "**Exploratory Analysis** <br/>\n",
    "To answer our research question \"Can we predict a player's total number of played hours based on characteristics such as experience, gender, age, and subscription?\", we first examined the players.csv dataset to identify which variables correlate with total played hours. This helped ensure our analysis would focus on variables with predictive value to minimize our RMSE.\n",
    "We began by loading the data from a Google Drive link using read_csv. We then cleaned the dataset by removing irrelevant columns (Individual ID and Organisation Name) that wouldn't affect our target variable of total hours played. We converted the categorical variables—experience, gender, and subscribe—to numerical values. Our exploratory data analysis revealed several insights through bar plots: subscribers tended to play more hours than non-subscribers, and amateur and regular players logged disproportionately more hours than other experience levels, regardless of group size. The gender analysis showed that while females and non-binary players made up a smaller portion of total players compared to males, they contributed a notably high number of played hours. These patterns suggested that these characteristics could help predict playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Analysis** <br/>\n",
    "We used forward selection to build our model by adding one predictor variable at a time to identify useful predictors. While forward selection requires training many models and may result in lower accuracy on test data, our project benefits from having a large dataset with relatively few predictors.\n",
    "First, we used the select function to extract a smaller set of predictors to work with, as well as the played_hours variable as the label. We also extracted the column names for the full set of predictors\n",
    "We implemented forward selection using two nested loops: an outer loop that increases the predictor set size (for (i in 1:n_total)) and an inner loop that tests which predictor to add in each round (for (j in 1:length(names))). For each combination of predictors, we created a model formula, incorporated it into a recipe, established a workflow with a K-NN classifier tuned through 5-fold cross-validation, and recorded the estimated accuracy.\n",
    "The model identified \"played_hours~subscribe + experience\" as the best predictor set, with the lowest RMSE of 26.57. Since adding gender and/or age increases the RMSE, we excluded these two variables from our prediction.\n",
    "Now, we were able to build our final model. Since played_hours is a numerical variable with no linear relationship to the predictor variables, we used K-NN regression for this task. We first split the data into training and test sets to assess our model's performance on unseen observations.\n",
    "Now we created our preprocessing recipe. Since we have more than one predictor, we scaled and centered the chosen predictors (subscribe and experience).\n",
    "Next, we created a K-nearest neighbors regression model specification. We then set up 5-fold cross-validation and combined the recipe and model specification into a workflow.\n",
    "Next, we ran  cross-validation for a grid of numbers of neighbors ranging from 1 to 100 and found the minimum RMSPE to determine the optimal number of neighbors. The output showed that the smallest RMSPE occurs when K = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we retrained our model on the entire dataset using K = 1 neighbors. We then used the predict function to make predictions on the test data and used the metrics function to compute the summary quality.\n"
